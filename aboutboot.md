# you have to mount the usb before you use it on linux.
how to mount it?
# /sys/dev and dev  
# virtual file system
# find real root dev  
```
cat /proc/cmdline # may be intermediate root filesystem
```
# dtname  

device tree
# cat?will delete file content?

# BOOT procedure linux embedded system
* SoC powered
* control pass to reset vector(the manufacture preprogram on to the board
* ROM Bootloader: setup basic hardware and find first stage bootloader from a boot device(network, memory bus
usb, sd card),load first stage bootloader into SoC internal memory and pass control to it.
* first stage bootloader: fetch second stage bootloader into RAM  BIOS and UEFI not only load the operating system from a non-volatile device, they also initialize system hardware for operating system. Examples of first-stage bootloaders include BIOS, coreboot, Libreboot and Das U-Boot.

* second stage :load the kernel and device tree into RAM; read its configurationi settings(statically embedded or external file); set up the Kernel Boot Arguments; Pass control to Kernel which uises the Boot Args and Device tree address to initializes itself and hardeare devices.
***
BIOS: motherboard firmware. 1.CHECK ALL the device are placed well.2. search for a bootable device. then pass control to os. Limitations: 1.drive support using MBR which can only access < 2TB of the hard disk.
As a rsult UEFI occurs: Unified extensible firmware interface
kernel: using Boot Arfs, Kernel locates and mounts the root filesytem; run init process(PID 0) to start userspace ; 
## distinguish between "pass control" and "call"  
pass control means: the previous program cease to exist
call meansï¼š the following process will return to the previous process
***
AMD integrate memory controller into cpu which is used to be external north bridge.
##  U-boot: secondstage bootloader (SSBL)
# packaging
DIP : dual in line
# Partition table
LBA defalt size: 512 bytes 
GPT disk : disk using GUID partition table
MBR: master boot record . stored on the first zone on the disk; fixed size
hard disk
RAM: volatile: lose everything once power is removed.common type: Double data rate synchrounous dynamic random access memory: DDRSDRAM
  DRAM: 1970s; Not regulated by clcok; asynchronous;
  SDRAM:sychronous; rely on clock to sychronize signals; transfer data on one edge of clock
  DDR: fetchdata both on leading edge and falling edge. From SDRAM to DDR SDRAM ...DDR2 SDRAM until DDR4 SDRAM, the operating voltage is lower while amount of data trasffered(words per clock cycle) is larger.
SSD: use flash memory
SD card 
USB
ddr memory
ramdisk
