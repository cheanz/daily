# you have to mount the usb before you use it on linux.
how to mount it?
# /sys/dev and dev  
# virtual file system
# find real root dev  
```
cat /proc/cmdline # may be intermediate root filesystem
```
# dtname  

device tree
# cat?will delete file content?

# BOOT procedure linux embedded system
* SoC powered
* control pass to reset vector(the manufacture preprogram on to the board
* ROM Bootloader: setup basic hardware and find first stage bootloader from a boot device(network, memory bus
usb, sd card),load first stage bootloader into SoC internal memory and pass control to it.
* first stage bootloader: fetch second stage bootloader into RAM  BIOS and UEFI not only load the operating system from a non-volatile device, they also initialize system hardware for operating system. Examples of first-stage bootloaders include BIOS, coreboot, Libreboot and Das U-Boot.

* second stage :load the kernel and device tree into RAM; read its configurationi settings(statically embedded or external file); set up the Kernel Boot Arguments; Pass control to Kernel which uises the Boot Args and Device tree address to initializes itself and hardeare devices.
***
BIOS: motherboard firmware. 1.CHECK ALL the device are placed well.2. search for a bootable device. then pass control to os. Limitations: 1.drive support using MBR which can only access < 2TB of the hard disk.
As a rsult UEFI occurs: Unified extensible firmware interface
kernel: using Boot Arfs, Kernel locates and mounts the root filesytem; run init process(PID 0) to start userspace ; 
## distinguish between "pass control" and "call"  
pass control means: the previous program cease to exist
call meansï¼š the following process will return to the previous process
***
AMD integrate memory controller into cpu which is used to be external north bridge.
##  U-boot: secondstage bootloader (SSBL)
# Partition table
LBA defalt size: 512 bytes 
GPT disk : disk using GUID partition table
MBR: master boot record . stored on the first zone on the disk; fixed size
